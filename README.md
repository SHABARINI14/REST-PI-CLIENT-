In this task,the WeatherApiClient.java program is a simple java application that demonstrates how to consume data from a public REST API and display it in a structured format. Specifically,it connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather information for a specified city.The program makes an HTTP GET request to retrieve the data in JSON format and then parses this response to extract useful details like the city name,tempe, humidity, and a short weather description. It then prints this information clearly to the console for the user to view. By using standard Java classes such as HttpURLConnection and the org.json library for JSON parsing, this program servers as an educational example of how Java applications can interact with RESTful web services to fetch and process real-time data.
